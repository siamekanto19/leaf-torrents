## Leaf Torrents
I know that Torrents aren't the most "Legal" thing to deal with in most parts of the world. I completely agree and respect that. I have just worked on this project for developing my skills. This is basically a Torrent Aggregator App that lets you search Torrents in various Websites from a single place. 

When you enter a Keyword in the Search Bar, it will scrap different popular Torrent Websites for your query and collect Torrent files related to that Keyword and return it to you in an organized, clean and beautiful UI. It will also provide you with the source and download links for most of the results.
